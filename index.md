I am a researcher in aerothermodynamics of atmospheric-entry vehicles using computational methods. I am a Python programming enthusiast and during my free time I maintain NAnPack library -- an open-source educational tool that I am developing for students in Computational Fluid Dynamics. 

{: .notice--info} The development version is available for download on Python Packaging Index (PyPI) and on my GitHub repository - [project-NAnPack](https://github.com/vxsharma-14/project-NAnPack).

Read more about my profile on [About](/about/) webpage.

Feel free to [email](mailto:vxsharma14@gmail.com) me for collaborations, seminar talks or for any other questions.
