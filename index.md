I am an inquisitive individual with a strong passion for data science and analytics. I love using my analytical skills to gain insights from data and visualizations and help organizations make informed decisions. One of my main tools for data analysis is coding in Python, which I have a strong proficiency in. I enjoy the challenges that come with working with large datasets and finding creative solutions to extract valuable insights. I am always eager to learn and expand my skills, and I am excited to bring my inquisitive nature and data analysis expertise to any project I take on.
