## Introduction

Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab are open-source web-based applications developed by [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Jupyter Notebooks are documentation-centric whereas JupyterLab is a development environment. According to the official webpage,  

> JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.  

> The Jupyter Notebook is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents. It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience.

## Benefits of using Jupyter Notebooks

* It is a **web-based application** that runs on any popular browser.
* You can easily **combine text, graphics, audio, and video in your documents**.
* It allows you to **document conveniently** using **markdown** syntax for plain text formatting and **LaTeX typesetting** for mathematical formatting.
* JupyterLab can be used as a **rapid prototyping tool**.
* Interactive coding functionality allows you to **write, execute, and debug codes quickly**.

If you are convinced that JupyterLab is for you, please read the next sections for the installation steps and to make yourself familiar with the JupyterLab interface.  

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install JupyterLab and other libraries that we will be using in this article series. The installation procedure suggested here is for **Windows OS**. If you are working on other operating systems or environments, please see the installation instructions on the links provided below.

1. Install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  

2. Install `pip` by following the instructions given in the [webpage here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

3. Install [IPython](https://ipython.org/install.html) by entering command `pip install ipython` on the terminal.  

4. Install JupyterLab using command `pip install jupyterlab` on the terminal.  

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note.** We are downloading Python for installation of PIP only and we will not be using any programming language including Python in this tutorial. So, no need to worry if you are not into programming.

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note.** Jupyter environment primarily supports Python programming, however, you can use its features with other programming languages too with [Jupyter kernels](https://jupyter.org/try#kernels).
{: .notice--info}  

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note.** IPython is a Python interpreter for Jupyter Notebooks. Read its [documentation here](https://ipython.org/documentation.html) to know more.
{: .notice--info}

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Info.** Visit official Jupyter [Installation](https://jupyter.org/install) and [Documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) webpages for further information.
{: .notice}  

An alternate approach is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) Python distribution which includes IPython interpreter.  

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Caution.** I prefer the first approach and therefore, I will be not be using `conda` environment in this article series.
{: .notice--warning}  

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note.** After you have installed JupyterLab, open command terminal on your Windows, change directory to the root directory where you want to start your project and type `jupyter lab` to start a JupyterLab session on your preferred browser.
{: .notice--info}  

<i class="fas fa-exclamation"></i> **Warning.** Closing the browser tab will not shut down the kernels. Use `Ctrl+C` on your terminal to shut down all kernels and terminate the JupyterLab session.
{: .notice--danger}  

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> **Tip.** If you accidentally close your browser, go to your terminal where you started the JupyterLab session, copy the URL that starts with `http://localhost:8888/` and paste it into the address bar of your browser to restore your JupyterLab session.

## Getting Used to JupyterLab Interface

### JupyterLab Launcher

[![JupyterLab launcher explanation](/assets/images/posts/jupyterlab1_post1.png)](/assets/images/posts/jupyterlab1_post1.png)  

**Create a File**  

Select a file type from the available options on the launcher window to create a new file. A new notebook can be created by clicking on the notebook option (see red box in the above image).  

**Opening a File**  

To open a file in the project directory, click on the *File Browser* (see green box in the above image) on the left sidebar to see the list of files and double click on the filename.  

**Renaming a File**  

Go to *File Browser*, right-click on the filename and use the *Rename* option to rename the file.  

**View Active Kernels, Tabs, and Terminals**  

View all the open tabs and active kernels and terminals by clicking the icon below the file browser, shown by blue box in the image above. You can shutdown the kernels and terminals from here.  

### Notebook Interface

[![JupyterLab notebook interface explanation](/assets/images/posts/jupyterlab1_post2.png)](/assets/images/posts/jupyterlab1_post2.png)  

**Cells**  

Cells in JupyterLab environment are the places where you add plain texts, code statements, images, videos, HTML, and LaTeX expressions. (See orange box in the above image).  

**Cell Types**  

Notebook allows three types of cell formatting - **Code**, **Markdown** and **Raw**. Code cell type allows you to write and execute code statements in the programming language of the active kernel. With markdown cell type you can write text in markdown syntax using all markdown formatting features. In a markdown cell, you can also use LaTeX syntax to write mathematical equations in your notebook. With raw cell type you can add markdown and LaTeX texts, however, the contents will not be rendered until you export the document in the desired format. 

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note.** Default kernel is Python.
{: .notice--info}  

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> **Tip.** Press `Shift+Enter` to execute the code statements or to render the markdown text in the selected cells.
{: .notice--success}  

**Change Cell Type**  

To change the cell type, select a cell, click on the dropdown box (see green box in the above image) and select a cell type from the list.  

**Change Kernel**  

To change the kernel type, click on the active kernel (see purple box in the above image) and select a kernel type from the list.  

**Tabs**  

All open files will appear as separate tabs on the interface. Tabs let you switch between different open files. In the image above, there is only one open tab.  

**Modes**  

There are two modes through which you can work with cells - **Edit** mode and **Command** mode.  

Edit mode lets you add/edit the contents of the cell. When you are in edit mode, you will see a caret inside the cell and the cell border is of blue-ish color (it may be green or blue on your computer). Command mode lets you perform notebook actions such as copy cell, run cell, delete cell and other options. In command mode, you will not see a caret (text cursor). In the image shown above of the notebook interface, the cell is in command mode.

### Frequently Used Menu Items

Below is the list of menu items that you will be using frequently. Users are encouraged to browse through all the menu items.  

**New**  

Go to the *File* menu, hover over *New* and select a filetype from the list to create a new file.  

**Save Notebook**  

Go to *File* menu and select *Save Notebook* to save the notebook.  

**Save and Export Notebook As**  

Go to *File* menu and hover over *Select and Export Notebook As* which will give you the options as shown in the image below to export notebook.  

[![types of notebook export](/assets/images/posts/jupyterlab1_post3.png)](/assets/images/posts/jupyterlab1_post3.png)  

Before exporting your notebook you will need to install the package **nbconvert** by entering the following command  

`pip install nbconvert`  

Instead of using *Save and Export Notebook As*, I use the terminal command for using nbconvert to convert the notebook to other formats.

`jupyter nbconvert --to <output format> <input notebook>`  

For example, convert a file my_notebook.ipynb to markdown by typing the following command

`jupyter nbconvert --to markdown my_notebook.ipynb`  

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note.** To utilize its full functionalities, **nbconvert** requires additional packages listed on their [website](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-nbconvert).
{: .notice--info}  

**Run Selected Cells**  

Go to the *Run* menu and select *Run Selected Cells* to execute the contents of the selected cells.  

**Render All Markdown Cells**  

Go to the *Run* menu and select *Render All Markdown Cells* to render all markdown cells in the notebook.  

**Run All Cells**  

Go to the *Run* menu and select *Run All Cells* to execute the contents of the selected cells.  

**Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs**  

Go to *Kernel* and select *Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs* to restart the kernel and clear all cell outputs. This is the option that I use the most for restarting the kernel.  

**Theme**  

Go to *Settings*, hover over *Theme* to view the list of theme options.  

**Text Editor Theme**  

Go to *Settings*, hover over *Text Editor Theme* to view the list of text editor theme options.
