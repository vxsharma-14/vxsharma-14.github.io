## Introduction: From Aerospace to Pixels

I started my career as an aerospace engineer before moving into Computer Vision. While these fields might seem very different, they actually have something important in common: they both involve making sense of complex information. In aerospace, we analyze how air moves around objects and how structures hold together. In Computer Vision, we teach computers to understand images and visual information.

My background in studying air flow and aircraft design gave me useful skills for working with images and computers. One of the most interesting new tools I've found in this field is called Vision Transformers (or ViTs for short). These are smart computer programs that were inspired by tools originally made for processing language.

In this article, we'll look at Vision Transformers - what they are, how they work, and why they're changing the way computers understand images.

## From Convolution Neural Networks to Vision Transformers

### The Dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) have been the main tool used in Computer Vision for many years. These computer programs are great at looking at images and learning to recognize important details in them. They've helped computers get much better at tasks like identifying objects in photos and understanding what's in an image. CNNs work by scanning images with special filters that help them pick out different features. Think of it like looking at a picture through different lenses - each lens helps you see different things. However, CNNs have one main weakness: they're not very good at understanding how different parts of an image relate to each other when they're far apart. This means they sometimes miss the bigger picture of what's happening in a scene.

### From Words to Pixels: The Rise of Vision Transformers

The deep learning tech is constantly evolving. In 2017, the Transformer architecture was introduced in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It demonstrated remarkable success in tasks like machine translation (text analysis). Transformers rely on a mechanism called "attention," which allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence and thus capturing both local and global relationships.

Then came the groundbreaking question: could we adapt Transformers to process images? In 2020, the Vision Transformer was introduced, which treats an image as a sequence of patches called as "tokens," similar to words in a sentence. This enables ViTs to effectively learn the relationships between different image regions, leading to a more holistic understanding of the visual content.

Here's a simplified breakdown of how Vision Transformers work:

1. **Image Patching:** An input image is divided into a grid of smaller, non-overlapping patches
2. **Linear Embedding:** Each patch is flattened into a vector and then linearly transformed into a higher-dimensional space.
3. **Sequence Input:** These embedded patches are treated as a sequence, similar to words in a sentence.
4. **Transformer Encoder:** This sequence of embedded patches is fed into a standard Transformer encoder, which consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks.
5. **Output:** The Transformer processes the sequence, and the output can be used for various tasks like image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation.

### Why Vision Transformers are Replacing CNNs

ViTs are increasingly replacing CNNs in many computer vision tasks due to their superior ability to model long-range dependencies and capture global context. CNNs excel at extracting local features through convolutional layers but they struggle to integrate information from distant parts of an image. This limitation hinders their performance in tasks where understanding the overall scene is crucial. 

ViTs employ self-attention mechanisms that allow them to weigh the importance of different image regions and thus they effectively capture both local and global relationships. As a result, ViTs achieve higher accuracy and better generalization, especially on large datasets. Additionally, the flexibility and scalability of the Transformer architecture make ViTs well-suited for a wide range of computer vision applications.
