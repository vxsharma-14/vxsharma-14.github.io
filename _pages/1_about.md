With over nine years of diverse experience in research, analytics, and management, I am currently working as a freelance Data Analyst. Through my PhD training, I have developed a range of transferrable skills that I am able to utilize in my current role, including data analysis and visualization, coding in Python pandas and working with MS Excel. I am able to offer my expertise to clients through platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr, as well as to small businesses seeking to better understand their operations through data analysis.

Throughout my career, I have worked in various industries including banking, education, and aerospace research. I hold a PhD in Aerospace Engineering from Wichita State University and run an online brand of festive decor products in India. I am always looking for new collaborators and clients to work with, and I am equipped with a wide range of skills and tools to help solve problems and provide valuable insights through data analysis. I am committed to helping businesses scale and streamline their operations.
