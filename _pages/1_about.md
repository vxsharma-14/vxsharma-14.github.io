I am offering freelancing services in CFD and Data Analytics. Having worked at two different multi-national banks in India and at Aerospace research labs in USA, I can offer a wide range of skills and tools, and help you scale and streamline your business requirements.  

Alongside, I am working on computational modeling and investigation of non-equilibrium thermo-chemical environment that occurs during atmospheric-entry of space capsules.  

I love writing Python codes.
